h2. Scripting and Styling on Rails

This guide will cover how to use the asset pipeline introduced in Rails 3.1 to add styling and scripting to your Rails application.
By using this guide, you will learn:

* How javascript, stylesheets, and images are organized in a Rails application.
* How to use SCSS to style your application.
* How to use coffeescript to add dynamic scripting to your app.
* How to include 3rd party libraries to your application.
* How to customize the asset pipeline.

h3. The Rails Asset Structure

With the release of Rails 3.1, assets have become a part of the core Rails architecture. Assets are comprised of stylesheets, script files and images associated with your application.

h4. Conventions of Rails Assets

Prior to Rails 3.1, there was no set convention on how assets were organized in a project. Assets were placed in the /public directory, and served directly, without any processing being performed by Rails or conventions defined on how CSS or script files should be structured.

Starting with Rails 3.1, javascript and stylesheets now have a conventional home, which helps you organize your assets more effectively. Rails generators now generate default stylesheets and coffeescript files, in their respective locations within the +app/assets/+ directory.

You can use this structure to help guide how you structure your rails application. If you have CSS or javascript that is related to a particular controller, include the code in the relevant controller file. By default, Rails will include all of the stylesheets and javascript files located within +app/assets+, and combine them into one file for you.

h4. Using third-party libraries within Rails

There are two ways that third-party javascript and CSS files can be included in a Rails application:

* **Through inclusion of a gem** - Gems can include their own assets, which will be included in your project when you include the gem in your Gemfile.
* **Adding to lib/assets** - If you want to include a 3rd party javascript or CSS file that is not packaged as a gem, you can add the assets to +lib/assets/javascript+ or +lib/assets/stylesheets+. Any asset files located within these directories will be included in your +application.js+ or +application.css+ automatically.

h3. Using SCSS

h4. About SCSS

SCSS or Sassy CSS is an extension of CSS3 adding functionality such as nesting, variables, and mixins. Each of these features bring the 'DRY' philosophy to our stylesheets. Within the context of the asset pipeline, all your SCSS files are precompiled into one valid CSS3 file and compressed for performance. You are also able to split up the css that is specific to certain aspects of your application into separate files to keep your CSS more organized.

h4. Using SCSS with a Rails app

Anytime that you use the scaffold or controller generator, such as:

<shell>
  $ rails g scaffold Contact
</shell>

It will generate a file (contacts.css.scss) for you in +app/assets/stylesheets+. Then when you run your rails server, and view your pages, the contents of all *.css.scss is compiled, included, and compressed into application.css. This allows you to only add one css file (application.css) into your site template resulting in fewer requests to the server and faster page load times. 

h3. Using CoffeeScript

h4. About CoffeeScript

In short, CoffeeScript is a language that compiles into JavaScript. It allows us to write great JavaScript code, and at the same time gives a lot of great features and functionality that modern languages provide us. Now, this sounds all well and great, but why does it matter to rails developers? JavaScript is becoming more and more integrated into our applications, and moving forward to CoffeeScript keeps with the notion of Ruby on Rails: having beautiful and readable code. 

h4. Using CoffeeScript with a Rails app

With the changes in Rails 3.1 now has CoffeeScript added to the Gemfile by default. This means that when you run your rails generators, such as:

<shell>
  $ rails g scaffold Contact name:string phone:string
</shell>

It will generate a file for you: contacts.js.coffee. Then when you run your rails server, and view your pages, the contacts.coffee has been compiled and included in the application.js. To learn more about how the asset_pipeline works, view the Asset Pipeline Rails Guide.

As an example, let's say you wish to load the contacts in the index.html.erb clientside with javascript. Take the following code

<html>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Phone</th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>

<% @contacts.each do |contact| %>
  <tr>
    <td><%= contact.name %></td>
    <td><%= contact.phone %></td>
    <td><%= link_to 'Show', contact %></td>
    <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_contact_path(contact) %></td>
    <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', contact, confirm: 'Are you sure?', method: :delete %></td>
  </tr>
<% end %>
</table>
</html>

and replace it with: 

<html>
  <table id="contacts_table">
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Phone</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </table>
</html>

Simply add the following code to the contacts.coffee.js file:

<html>
$ ->
  $.ajax({
    url:'/contacts.json'
    success: (contacts) ->
      for c in contacts
        $('#contacts_table').append(contact_row(c));
  })
  
contact_row = (c) ->
  out = '<tr><td>' + c.name + '</td><td>' + c.phone + '</td>' +
    '<td><a href="/contacts/' + c.id + '">Show</a></td>' +
    '<td><a href="/contacts/' + c.id + '/edit">Edit</a></td>' +
    '<td><a href="/contacts/' + c.id + '" data-confirm="Are you sure?" data-method="delete" rel="nofollow">Destroy</a></td></tr>'
</html>

The first line is calling the dollarsign function for jQuery. Using a -> <abbr>dashrocket</abbr> here passes an anonymous function, with everything tabbed in below as part of that function. I then call the ajax function as part of jQuery to the contacts.json url. I then pass the contacts inside the paranthesis followed by a dashrocket. This sets up another anonymous function, accepting the parameter named contacts. Then using the for command in CoffeeScript with the contacts parameter, I loop through the contacts data and use my contact_row helper function to append it to the table. To learn how the for command, and loops work, have a look at the documentation on the CoffeeScript <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#loops">website</a>. Looking at the contact_row defintion, you can see that a named function is setup very similarly to that of an anonymous function in coffeescript, you just use a variable name and equal sign to set it. 

Here is the compiled code: 

<html>
var contact_row;
$(function() {
  return $.ajax({
    url: '/contacts.json',
    success: function(contacts) {
      var c, _i, _len, _results;
      _results = [];
      for (_i = 0, _len = contacts.length; _i < _len; _i++) {
        c = contacts[_i];
        _results.push($('#contacts_table').append(contact_row(c)));
      }
      return _results;
    }
  });
});
contact_row = function(c) {
  var out;
  return out = '<tr><td>' + c.name + '</td><td>' + c.phone + '</td>' + '<td><a href="/contacts/' + c.id + '">Show</a></td>' + '<td><a href="/contacts/' + c.id + '/edit">Edit</a></td>' + '<td><a href="/contacts/' + c.id + '" data-confirm="Are you sure?" data-method="delete" rel="nofollow">Destroy</a></td></tr>';
};
</html>
